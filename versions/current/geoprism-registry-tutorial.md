# GeoPrism Registry Tutorial

### 6.1 GeoPrism Registry Sandbox

### 6.1.1 Purpose

The GeoPrism Registry sandbox is a controlled testing and demo environment that resets at 12:00 AM Geneva, Switzerland (GMT+1) every day. This allows users to test and learn about the GeoPrism Registry functionalities without the risk of affecting some specific content.

Because of the above, the sandbox is used as the reference for all the examples included in the present tutorial.

### 6.1.2 Organizations and roles

The Tolkien dataset has been designed in such a way that it is distributed among 3 organizations: &#x20;

* Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA)&#x20;
* Ministry of Health (MOH)&#x20;
* Ministry of Education (MOE)

For each of these organizations, a Registry Administrator (RA), Registry Maintainer (RM) and Registry Contributor (RC) user role has been created. Users can also access the demo instance as a System Administrator (SA). Please refer to the [CGR role section ](geoprism-registry-key-components.md#5.3-user-roles-and-their-rights)for more details on each of them.
