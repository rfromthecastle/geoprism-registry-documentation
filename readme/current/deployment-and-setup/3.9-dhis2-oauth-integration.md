# 3.9 DHIS2 Oauth Integration

GeoPrism Registry supports Oauth integration with DHIS2. This is accomplished primarily using GeoPrism Registries External Systems. This guide will walk you through the process of integrating GeoPrism Registry with DHIS2 Oauth.

### Configuring DHIS2

DHIS2 must be configured to allow the GeoPrism Registry to connect to it. This is accomplished using DHIS2’s “OAuth2 Clients” configuration. This can be found in your DHIS2 “System Settings” app.\

Clicking the blue Plus button on the right allows us to create a new Oauth client.

#### Configure the Oauth client:

1. Name: georegistry
2. Client ID: georegistry
3. Client Secret:
4. Grant Types:
   1. Password: no
   2. Refresh token: no
   3. Authorization code: yes
5. Redirect URIS: https:///cgrsession/ologin
   1. If your server is not using https, you should use http here instead. This must match the url of your server.\

6. Take note of the Client Secret which is generated here. We will need it when configuring GeoPrism Registry External Systems with OAuth.&#x20;
7. Click save to create the new OAuth2 client in DHIS2.
