# 6.5.1.1 Import

{% hint style="info" %}
Registry Administrators and Registry Maintainers can import the lists and spatial data of the Geo-Object Types under the curation mandate of their organization
{% endhint %}

To import Geo-Object data into the GPR, we have to take into account the Geo-Object Types, attributes, and hierarchies that have been defined. The data to be imported needs to be formatted so the fields/columns can be mapped onto the attributes of the relevant Geo-Object Type, and where available, hierarchy information can be matched with the correct hierarchy.

### Import a spreadsheet (list)

Lists are imported in the GPR under the form of a spreadsheet.

To be able to import a list to the GPR smoothly, the following basic requirements must be followed:&#x20;

* The spreadsheet must be in XLSX format.&#x20;
* Contain the values for all the attributes that have been defined in the data dictionary as well as the parents for the hierarchies the geo-object type contributes to&#x20;
* A header must exist on the first row that contains the unique label for each attribute.&#x20;
* Each column must be set to the appropriate data type.&#x20;
* The data should be in the first worksheet of the XLSX file. All other worksheets will be ignored by the system.&#x20;
* There should be no formula in the spreadsheet as these are not supported.&#x20;
* Geographic coordinates included in the spreadsheet must be unprojected (EPSG:4326 (WGS84)) and stored in separated columns (lat/long)

#### Follow these steps to import a spreadsheet:&#x20;

1. Go to the Import module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Import.\

### Import a shapefile

Spatial data is imported in the GPR under the form of shapefiles.

To be able to import shapefiles to the GPR smoothly, the following basic requirements must be followed:&#x20;

* The spatial data must be in shapefile format.&#x20;
* As a shapefile consists of multiple files that collectively make up a shapefile, these files must be compressed into a zipped (.zip) file before importing.&#x20;
* The shapefile must include data only for a single geo-object type.&#x20;
* The shapefile must be unprojected (EPSG:4326 (WGS84)). If this is not the case, the GPR will give an error message and the import will not take place.

Follow these steps to import a shapefile:&#x20;

1. Go to the Import module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Import.\

    | Import Strategy    | <p>The import strategy for the shapefile being imported: </p><ul><li>New and update: This will import the geo-objects and associated attributes in the shapefile that are not yet in the GPR as well as overwrite the attributes of the geo-objects from the shapefile that are already in the GPR. </li><li>New only: This will import only the geo-objects from the shapefile that are not yet in the GPR. If the imported file contains geo-objects that were already in the GPR (same unique ID and/or label depending on what is selected during the matching) then the import will fail to avoid creating duplicates. </li><li>Update only: This will overwrite the attributes of the geo-objects from the list that are already in the GPR. If the imported file contains geo-objects that are not already in the graph then these will not be imported.</li></ul> | Required |
    | Start Date         | The start of the date of validity of the geo-objects in the shapefile. All the geo-objects in the shapefile being imported, whether new or for update, should have the same start date of validity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Required |
    | End Date           | The end of the date of validity of the geo-objects in the shapefile. All the geo-objects in the shapefile being imported, whether new or for update, should have the same end date of validity. If the shapefile is still valid on the date it is being imported in the GPR, click the Set as most current button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Required |
    | Import blank cells | Selecting this option ensures that if there are empty cells in the list being imported that they are imported as empty attribute values (overwrite). This option gives more control to ensure that updates will either only update cells with values or to overwrite existing values with null values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |          |

   Note: When the shapefile is formatted correctly and completely as mentioned at the start of this section, you should be able to match all of its attributes to the Geo-Object Type for which it is being imported. Otherwise, some of the attributes will be left blank.
8.  The Hierarchy Matching window opens listing the Geo-Object Type/s above (parent) of the Geo-Object Type for which the shapefile is being imported in the hierarchy belongs to. The number of Geo-Object Types that will be listed depends on the position in the hierarchy of the Geo-Object Type for which the shapefile is being imported. Fill out the following fields for each parent Geo-Object Type:\
