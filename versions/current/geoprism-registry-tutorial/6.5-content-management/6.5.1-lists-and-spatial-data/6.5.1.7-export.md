{% hint style="info" %}
Registry Administrators, Registry Maintainers, and Registry Contributors can export the lists and spatial data for the Geo-Object Types and Geo-Object Types belonging to other organizations that are publicly visible.
{% endhint %}

The list and spatial data of a Geo-Object Type can be exported respectively as a spreadsheet or a shapefile as follow:

1. Go to the Lists and Spatial Data module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Lists and Spatial Data.\

2. On the left sidebar, find and click the Geo-Object Type whose list and/or spatial data you would like to export. Then click on the set (list and spatial data) from which you want to perform the export. (The Community health worker Geo-Object Type in the example below.)\

3. Depending on the type of set, you might see one or more instances in the set (one per date or period of validity). Decide for which instance you want to do the export (only one in the example here, dated 2022-03-03) and if you want to export the working version or the published version and under that version, click List.\

6. The data has been downloaded. Check the default downloads folder of your computer for the downloaded data.
7. The downloaded file will contain the following depending on what has been selected:
   1. The downloaded list is in .XLSX format with the file name being the Geo-Object Type Code and the start date of validity of the selected list. In the example below, the downloaded list is of the Community health worker with the starting date of validity of 2022-03-03 so the downloaded file name is CHW-2022-03-03.xlsx. This Excel file has 3 worksheets:
      1. The first worksheet contains the list of the Geo-Objects as it appears in the GPR. The worksheet name is the first 31 characters of the name of the list and spatial data set in the GPR.\

      2. The second worksheet is the metadata containing the information about the list.\
         ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (16) (1).png>)
      3. The third worksheet is the data dictionary providing details about the different fields/columns in the lists.\
         ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png>)
   2. The downloaded spatial data is stored in a compressed file (.ZIP) with the file name being the Geo-Object Type Code and the start date of validity of the selected spatial data. In the example below, the downloaded spatial data is of the Community health worker with the starting date of validity of 2022-03-03 so the downloaded file name is CHW-2022-03-03.zip.The .ZIP file contains the six (6) files composing a shapefile and a metadata file containing the information about the shapefile in .XLSX file format.\

      1. You may now open the shapefile in your preferred GIS software. The attribute table of the shapefile contains the information about the Geo-Objects as it appears in the GPR. The field names are abbreviated due to the field name length restriction. You will find the complete description of the field names in the Data Dictionary worksheet of the Metadata file.\

      2. The metadata files contains two (2) worksheets, metadata and data dictionary, whose content is the same as the one obtained when downloading the list\
