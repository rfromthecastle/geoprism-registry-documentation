# 3.4.3 Add or edit a locale in the exported spreadsheet

The exported localized MS Excel file contains the following 4 worksheets:

* **Exceptions**: Messages provided to the user in case the action performed by the user was invalid&#x20;
* **Core Exceptions**: Messages provided to the user when reaching an exception core to the platform functionalities&#x20;
* **UI Text**: Terms and sentences used in the user interface&#x20;
* **Registry Metadata**: terms and sentences related to the geo-object types and hierarchies that have been created in the GPR

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important notes**&#x20;

1. The GPR does automatically create the header of the column in which you have to include the translation (eg. pt\_MZ). Do not change this header&#x20;
2. Do not reorder columns, tabs, or change keys or column headers or types in this file. The system needs this data to be able to read the spreadsheet.&#x20;
3. Do not change the label on the tabs&#x20;
4. Keep the special characters unchanged in the translation (e.g. \[{0}], ${,... )&#x20;
5. The same term/sentence to be translated appears several times in the Registry metadata worksheet. It is recommended to sort that worksheet according to the defaultLocale column to facilitate the translation work
{% endhint %}

In order to add a locale in the exported spreadsheet:&#x20;

1. Go to each worksheet, one by one, and:&#x20;
2. In the column on the right of the defaultLocale you should find the column presenting the header generated by the GPR (eg. pt\_MZ)&#x20;
3. In this empty column, include the translation of each term from the defaultLocale in the corresponding cell. Example:\
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

As geo-object types, hierarchies or other elements are being in the GPR, the number of terms and sentences will increase in the Registry Metadata spreadsheet of the MS Excel file. It can also be that users notice the need for improving the translation of some of the terms or sentences being used.

In this case, it is always possible for the SA to re-export the localisation MSExcel file, make the necessary changes before re-importing it following the steps indicated in the next section.
