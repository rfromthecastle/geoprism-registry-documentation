2. In the _History_ tab, fill out the following fields for the historical events you would like to export:
   1. _Geo-Object Type:_ choose the Geo-Object Type. This could either be the 'before' or 'after' Geo-Object Type for the historical events
   2. _Start Date:_ type or select the starting date of the range of time of the historical events you would like to export
   3.  _End Date:_ type or select the end date of the range of time of the historical events you would like to export. If you would like to export the historical events that are valid until the present date, click the **Set as most current** button.\

3.  Click the **Submit** button. All historical events involving the selected geo-object type which happened between the start and end dates will be shown. In the example below, all historical events involving the _Shire (MOHA)_ Geo-Object Type valid from 2007-04-20 to the present are shown.\

4.  In case you would like to export the historical events for only one particular date, type or select that date for both the _Start Date_ and _End Date_ fields. Then click the **Submit** button. From the example above, if you would like to export only the historical events that happened on April 20, 2007 (2007-04-20) related to the 'Reassignment of Shires due to the creation of the Orrostar Province', set both the _Start Date_ and _End Date_ fields to “2007-04-20” and then click the **Submit** button. You will now see that only the historical events for that date are shown in the list.\
