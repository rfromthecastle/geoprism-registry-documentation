# 5.4.1 Home page



The home page is the first view the user sees after logging in to the GeoPrism Registry. It is organized in such a way that it allows users to (see figure below):&#x20;

1. Access each module either by clicking on the corresponding module icons (1 in the figure) or the module item from the burger menu&#x20;
2. Access the settings for the platform from the burger menu&#x20;
3. Switch locales for the interface in case different locales have been imported&#x20;
4. Access its own user information by clicking on the username appearing next to the burger menu&#x20;
5. Log out from the burger menu \

The functionalities provided by the GeoPrism Registry are organized in modules. The modules that a user has access to is determined by their role (see [Section 5.3 User roles and rights](5.4.1-home-page.md#5.3-user-roles-and-their-rights)).

For example, the home page will look like this once accessed by a user having a RC role:
