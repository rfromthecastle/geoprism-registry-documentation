# 5.3 User roles and their rights



### 5.3 User roles and their rights

This section describes which roles are currently implemented in the GPR platform before describing which rights each of these roles has.

### 5.3.1 Roles covered by the platform

These are the roles currently implemented in the GeoPrism Registry:&#x20;

* **System Administrator (SA):** User who is part of the GeoPrism Registry cross-sectoral governance structure who can set the platform, manage organizations and Registry Administrators user accounts, and view the public data across organizations.&#x20;
* **Registry Administrator (RA)**: User attached to a given organization and who has all the privileges of a RM plus the possibility to define user roles, create Geo-Object types and hierarchies and consult all the data under the mandate of his organization.&#x20;
* **Registry Maintainer (RM)**: User attached to a given organization and who has all the privileges of a RC plus the possibility to edit the CGR content for specific Geo-Object types under the curation mandate of that organization.&#x20;
* **Registry Contributor (RC)**: User attached to a given organization and who has the possibility to consult the CGR content for specific GeoObject types under the curation mandate of that organization and submit change requests about them.

In addition to the above, you can also access the platform through a REST API (See [Chapter 4](../external-system-integration.md)) that uses the same roles for authentication.

There is no anonymous user being implemented. The plan is for any deployment to be able to use the API to create an interface that will provide access to all the public data stored within the GPR.

### 5.3.2 Rights by role

**The tables below present the rights by role currently implemented in the GeoPrism Registry. These are organized according to the steps in the CGR data/information flow (**[**https://healthgeolab.net/DOCUMENTS/Guidance\_Common\_Geo-registry\_Ve2.pdf**](https://healthgeolab.net/DOCUMENTS/Guidance\_Common\_Geo-registry\_Ve2.pdf)**):**

The legend for the numbers indicated under each role is as follow:&#x20;

1. For all the organizations&#x20;
2. For his organization (for all the geographic object types)&#x20;
3. For his organization (geographic object types over which the user has the curation mandate)

Two examples on how to the read the information for each role:&#x20;

* Cell highlighted in gray: The SA role can view the information of an organization for all the organizations.&#x20;
* Cell highlighted in blue: The RA can manage data elements (including classification tables) for the private geographic object types and/or hierarchies for his organization (any geographic object type)
