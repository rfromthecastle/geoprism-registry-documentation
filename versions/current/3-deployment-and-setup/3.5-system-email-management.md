# 3.5 System email management

The GPR is capable of sending email notifications to users of the system, namely account creation invitations and automated change request notifications. Email configuration must be done by a System Administrator.

The GPR is not directly capable of sending emails by itself. It must be connected to a remote email server which is capable of sending those emails on behalf of the GPR. This settings page will enable you to configure the connection with that remote email server.

**Note:** The system only works with Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) compliant email servers.
