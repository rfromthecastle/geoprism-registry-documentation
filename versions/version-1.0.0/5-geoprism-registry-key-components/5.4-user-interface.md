# 5.4 User interface

This section describes the user interface of the GPR platform for the home page as well as the modules the users are having access to depending on their role.

### 5.4.1 Home page

The home page is the first view the user sees after logging in to the GeoPrism Registry. It is organized in such a way that it allows users to (see figure below):&#x20;

1. Access each module either by clicking on the corresponding module icons (1 in the figure) or the module item from the burger menu&#x20;
2. Access the settings for the platform from the burger menu&#x20;
3. Switch locales for the interface in case different locales have been imported&#x20;
4. Access its own user information by clicking on the username appearing next to the burger menu&#x20;
5. Log out from the burger menu&#x20;

The functionalities provided by the GeoPrism Registry are organized in modules. The modules that a user has access to is determined by their role (see [Section 5.3 User roles and rights](5.4-user-interface.md#5.3-user-roles-and-their-rights)).

For example, the home page will look like this once accessed by a user having a RC role:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/pasted image 0.png>)

### 5.4.2 Modules

The functionalities of GeoPrism are organized in modules accessible from the home page or the burger menu. What can perform in each module depends on the user role is described in the [rights by role section](5.4-user-interface.md#5.3-user-roles-and-their-rights).

The modules currently included in the GPR ar as follow:

The general layout of modules is structured in four ways:&#x20;

1. A unique window containing a set of fields to be completed (import)&#x20;
2. A unique window with horizontal sections that can expand depending on the actions being taken (scheduled jobs, change requests, curation)&#x20;
3. A window separated into two vertical panels (geo-object type and hierarchies, lists and spatial data&#x20;
4. A unique window with side panels that can be displayed or not (explorer)

For types 1 and 2, the user will start from the top of the window to complete the desired action.

For type 3, the user will first have to select items (geo-object types, hierarchies) in the left panel for the information to appear in the right panel and then be able to complete the desired action in that panel.

For type 4, the user might first have to expand one of the panels before being able to complete the desired action.

### 5.4.3 Settings

The GPR settings are accessible from the hamburger menu. The settings window is separated in different sections which are accessible or not depending on the user role as presented here:
