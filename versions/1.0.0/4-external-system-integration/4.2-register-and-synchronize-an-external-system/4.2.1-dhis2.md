### Compatibility

Integration with DHIS2 requires use of DHIS2 OAuth security integration. Not all versions of DHIS2 are known to be capable of integrating with the GPR via OAuth. The following table represents whether or not the steps in this document have been found to work with the listed version of DHIS2.

| DHIS2 version | Integration via OAuth possible?    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 2.35.1        | <mark style="color:red;">No</mark> |
| 2.35.0        | <mark style="color:red;">No</mark> |
| 2.34.2        | Yes                                |
| 2.33.7        | Yes                                |
| 2.32.7        | Yes                                |
| 2.31.9        | Yes                                |

### Import

If Geo-Object data is already present as organization units in a DHIS2 instance, it must first be imported using the ‘Import from an external system’ option in the Import module.

### Synchronization

The GPR supports using a DHIS2 external system synchronization to push data to a DHIS2 instance. The purpose of the external system synchronization is to define how Geo-Object Types in a specific hierarchy will map to organization units in a DHIS2 instance. The latest version of the Geo-Objects will be synchronized with DHIS2, as the GPR currently does not support exporting at a specific date.

The following steps are to be followed to enable the synchronization:

1. Navigate to the Settings page.\
   ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Mjs1dPobR-fLkJrgb4GVHyS4\_mCR0stID7QYzh2ZCnPtCuwa0wlL8Sr2LYlyK2XVmCBYX5-HTMnaUn2SiDDg1ICZ9iH5E4KGUL-HnnZ692GVAS0\_E4aqULXWF4\_XgzAzqm5YBvWyGcF48XPJQvfWSpHISabhWwaZeKh3Byz2ETT3zkZVcE6Au1gP)
2. Find the External “System Synchronizations” section and click on the Register Synchronization button.\

| Field           | Description                                                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Label           | Label of the synchronization configuration.                                                               |
| Organization    | The organization the synchronization configuration will be available to.                                  |
| Hierarchy       | The hierarchy this synchronization will use to push data to an external system.                           |
| External System | The registered external system that this synchronization will use to push data to an external system.     |
| Org Units       | A mapping between the Geo-Object Types in the selected GPR hierarchy and the types in the DHIS2 instance. |

### Matching organization units

The Org Units section of the configuration dialog allows you to map each Organization Unit Level in DHIS2 to a Geo-Object Type in the GPR. There is no limit to the amount of levels that can be matched, however no more levels should be matched than exist in the DHIS2 instance being synchronized with. Additionally, the matched Geo-Object Type of each level should be a direct child of the level before it.

The Geo-Objects in the GPR are matched to their DHIS2 counterparts using the external identifiers of the GPR Geo-Object and the identifiers of the Organization Unit in DHIS2. It is important to note that this matching does not use the Code properties from either system. If a Geo-Object does not have an external identifier, then it will be considered new and will be created in DHIS2 if the synchronization type is set to ‘Org Units and Relationships’. The GPR will then save the external identifier of that new Organization Unit in the database to be used for future updates. If the Geo-Object has an external identifier while DHIS2 does not have an organization unit with a matching identifier in their system, an error will be thrown.

The DHIS2 Synchronization Type specifies what data will be synchronized to DHIS2.

| Synchronization Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Org Units                   | Synchronizes attributes from Geo-Objects over to existing Organization Units in DHIS2. New Geo-Objects cannot be synchronized with this setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Relationships               | Synchronizes relationships between Geo-Objects with DHIS2. If an Organization Unit in DHIS2 has a different parent than what exists in the GPR, the existing parent will be set to the one in the GPR. If multiple parents in the GPR are detected for a Geo-Object an error will be thrown and the relationship will not be exported. New Geo-Objects cannot be synchronized with this setting. |
| Org Units and Relationships | Synchronizes both attributes and relationships over to DHIS2. If the Organization Unit does not exist in DHIS2 it will be created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Matching organization unit groups

Geo-Object Types (levels) can be matched to an organization unit group, so that only select organization units within that group are synchronized. The ‘Org Unit Group’ dropdown lists all organization unit groups which currently exist in the DHIS2 instance. When a Geo-Object Type is matched to a group, all Geo-Objects that are of that Geo-Object Type will be assigned to the selected organization unit group the next time the system synchronizes with this configuration.

This behavior operates in an additive fashion only. Any organization units which are already assigned to the organization unit group will not be affected.

### Custom attribute matching

If a Geo-Object Type is matched which contains custom attributes, the custom attribute matcher will be displayed.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/O1ORzXriTurdLLTWNUVJziAW29quthwMs1vPg0mDBN6WrsTnGxbQU84INNoNtt0mqOprA1a5FyuXCqV53PJyAcz\_MBx-COImybDBXbpgbGRz9y3WFhmWV\_ZOpF3Mw0ByZ0oVu6yoUcZ30OUSi\_jC1Gajf\_4IC6xQ4yzEym8VtyjqYRxpAdeEVESl)

This attribute matching is specific to a Geo-Object Type and level. In order for a DHIS2 attribute to be a valid selection for the matching, it must be applied to organization units, and it must be close enough in Type to be a candidate. Here are the appropriate selection types:

| GPR data type | Appropriate DHIS2 value types                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text          | Text, Long Text, Letter, Phone Number, Email, Username, URL |
| Boolean       | Boolean, True Only                                          |
| Date          | Date, Date Time, Time, Age                                  |
| Integer       | Integer, Integer Positive, Integer Negative, Integer Zero   |
| Decimal       | Number, Unit Interval, Percentage                           |
| Term          | Option Set                                                  |

The following DHIS2 value types cannot be mapped to attributes in the GPR:

* Tracker Associate&#x20;
* Coordinate&#x20;
* Organization Unit&#x20;
* File Resource&#x20;
* Image

If an attribute in the GPR is not matched to one in DHIS2 (either because there were no valid selections, or the dropdown was intentionally left as ‘not matched’), then the data in that attribute will not be synchronized with DHIS2. It will not, however, prevent the rest of the attributes or relationships from being synchronized.

### Term matching

#### **A. Option sets**

GPR Term-type attributes can be matched to DHIS2 option sets. When the ‘Target Type’ is set to ‘Option Set’, the ‘Target Attribute’ dropdown will populate with all DHIS2 attributes which contain an option set and are assigned to organization units. When a GPR Term-type attribute is matched to a valid option set in the DHIS2, then the user interface expands to allow matching between GPR terms and DHIS2 options.\

If a Geo-Object does not have values for the Term-type attribute, then the attribute will not be set on the DHIS2 Organization Unit. Geo-Objects with terms which have not been matched (‘Not Mapped’) will not be exported and an error will be presented.

#### **B. Organization unit groups**

Terms can also be mapped instead to Organization Unit Groups. This can be done by selecting ‘Org Unit Group’ in the ‘Target Type’ dropdown.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/danEb936Lz7r-XCSYI8CnuL8FJLYe0STzjOdXOd\_b88rulfdpfnPKLKfsuW8lbSFAKUCenQAqzqB4UDJl2k-Z6Qfh8DHHSwFz3sHFEH2h4IM6fNoLXNlmeIheEdPlXUTcibfmqpyBMXi3YJS8X0s6\_jvCUa5Aw0Y2QsoT0-6oX0RchNXNMBygxRD)

Geo-Objects will be assigned to the Organization Unit Group as matched in the above screenshot. This provides some basic support for Org Unit Group synchronization.

Similar to option set matching, if a Geo-Object does not have a value for the Term-type attribute, then it will not be assigned to an Organization Unit Group. Geo-Objects with terms which have not been matched (‘Not Mapped’) will not be exported and an error will be presented.

This behavior operates in an additive fashion only. Any organization units which are already assigned to the organization unit Group will not be affected.

If a level is matched to a DHIS2 organization unit group, and the Geo-Object Type also contains a term which is matched to DHIS2 organization unit groups, then the synchronized organization unit will be added to all organization unit groups which have been matched (in an additive fashion).

### **DHIS2 to CGR plugin**

The GPR provides a plugin which can be downloaded and installed into a DHIS2 instance. When installed into DHIS2 this plugin behaves as a standard DHIS2 app, which will redirect to the CGR instance configured in the External System.

To download the DHIS2 to CGR Plugin:

1. Navigate to an existing DHIS2 external system configuration form from the CGR settings page.&#x20;
2. Click the Download DHIS2 Plugin button, which will download a zip file called “cgr-dhis2-app.zip” to your computer.\
