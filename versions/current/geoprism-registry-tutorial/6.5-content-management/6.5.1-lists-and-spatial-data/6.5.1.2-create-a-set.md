# 6.5.1.2 Create a set

{% hint style="info" %}
Registry Administrators and Registry Maintainers can create a set of the lists and spatial data of the Geo-Object Types under the curation mandate of their organization.
{% endhint %}

#### To create a set:

1. Go to the Lists and Spatial Data module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Lists and Spatial Data.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1).png>)
2. On the left sidebar, find the organization of which you are a member (it should be the first organization on the list). The Geo-Object Types that have been created are listed under each organization they belong to. Under your organization, click on the Geo-Object type for which you are creating a new set.\

3. Click the Create New List and Spatial Data button.\

4. The Configuration window opens. First, select the type of list by clicking the corresponding radio button:\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)\
   a. Single date: This list type publishes lists that show the state of all Geo-Objects on a single given date. \
   b. Frequency-based: This list type publishes lists at a fixed frequency (annual, biannual, quarterly, monthly) from a given start date. \
   c. Period-based: This list publishes lists for each specified validity period where all the attribute, hierarchy and geometry values of all Geo-Objects for a given Geo-Object Type are the same.
5.  Fill out all the required fields and any optional fields that are relevant in the form.\

9. Once created, you will see the created set on the page. Click on its name/title.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)
10. You will see the imported list and spatial data for the Geo-Object Type. Click the _Metadata_ button.\
    ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (2).png>)
11. Set the following parameters for both the list and spatial data:
    1. Is Master: Check the box if list or spatial data is the master data
    2. Visibility: Choose either public (visible to users of all organizations) or private (visible only to users of your own organization)\
       ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png>)\


You have now created a set of list and spatial data including their metadata.
