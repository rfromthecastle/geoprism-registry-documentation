# 6.2 Logging in

There are two ways a user can log in to the GPR. These methods are described in detail below.

### 6.2.1 Local GeoPrism Registry credentials

Logging in using this approach is done following these steps:&#x20;

1. In the GPR login page, type the username and password assigned to you in the appropriate fields.\

2. Click the Login button.

### 6.2.2 DHIS2 credentials

The GPR supports logging in with DHIS2 credentials using OAuth 2.0 for a specific DHIS2 instance.

{% hint style="info" %}
To log in with this method a user must first exist in both the GPR and DHIS2 instance with the same user name and the GPR user must have OAuth enabled. For more information about creating or configuring GPR users to use OAuth see the user management section.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Requires the DHIS2 instance to be registered as an external system in the GPR.
{% endhint %}

1. Ensure that the DHIS2 instance you want to use to connect is registered as an external system (see the [registering a new DHIS2 external system](../4-external-system-integration/) section for more info).&#x20;
2. From the GPRlogin page, click the Log in with DHIS2 button.\

3. If there is more than one DHIS2 external system registered, a dropdown will appear of all the registered DHIS2 instances. Select the instance you want to use to login with which will route you to the login screen of that instance. If there is only one system you will be routed to the login screen of that instance without needing to select that instance from a dropdown.\
