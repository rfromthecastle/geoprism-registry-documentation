# 6.5.1.3 Manage the versions part of a set

{% hint style="info" %}
Registry Administrators and Registry Maintainers can manage versions of an instance part of a set created for the Geo-Object Types under the curation mandate of their organization.
{% endhint %}

Creating a set for a given geo-object type generates two types of versions for each instance part of this set:&#x20;

* The Working version allows the authorized user to access the graph either for viewing or editing. This version is generated automatically by the GPR and does therefore not have to be generated manually&#x20;
* The published (term to be changed) versions correspond to a snapshot in time of the content of the graph for the date or period for which the instance part of the set has been created. This type of version can not be modified but it can still be explored and exported

1. Go to the Lists and Spatial Data module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Lists and Spatial Data.\

2. On the left sidebar, find the organization of which you are a member (it should be the first organization on the list). The Geo-Object Types that have been created are listed under each organization they belong to. Under your organization, click on the Geo-Object Type for which you would like to publish a version. In the example below, the Community health worker (MOH) Geo-Object Type is selected.\

3. Click on the name of the list and spatial data set for which you would like to publish a version. In the example below, the frequency-based set is selected.\

4. Depending on the list type of the selected set as well as the frequency or the number of periods set, there could be one or more validity dates in the set. Find the validity date that you would like to publish a version of and click the New Version button.\

5. The metadata window will open. This contains the metadata information of the list and spatial data set (see step 7 in Section 6.5.1.2). The metadata information of either the list or spatial data or both can be edited to reflect the information of the version being published.\

8. To explore the published version, follow the relevant steps in section 6.5.1.4 Explore.&#x20;
9. To export the published version, follow the relevant steps in 6.5.1.7 Export.&#x20;
10. If changes are made to the working version of the list and/or spatial data, you may create another version of the dataset by repeating the relevant steps above.&#x20;
11. The published version can also be deleted by clicking the Delete button and confirming the deletion when prompted.\
