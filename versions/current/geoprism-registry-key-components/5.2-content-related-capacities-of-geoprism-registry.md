# 5.2 Content related capacities of GeoPrism Registry

The following sections describe in more detail the capacities of the GeoPrism Registry in managing the content being hosted in the platform ([Section 5.1](5.2-content-related-capacities-of-geoprism-registry.md#5.1-content)).

### 5.2.1 Changes over time

Geography evolves over time (creation of a new district, closing of a health facility, change of phone number for a community health worker).

This is why a core function of the GeoPrism Registry is to be able to capture the changes that are occurring over time for the geographic objects it hosts as well as conserve the information as it was before the change and, when applicable, the information necessary to rebuild the change (e.g., the unique identifier and name of the district from which a new district has been carved). This information is critical to perform trend analysis, especially in countries where the administrative structure changes frequently (e.g. to reconstruct disease prevalence trends across districts that have changed over time).

This capability of the GeoPrism Registry allows the retrieval of the lists and associated geospatial data for any geographic object at any point in time over the entire period for which data has been uploaded in the platform.

The three main types of changes that can be captured in the GeoPrism Registry for any given geographic object are presented in Table 3.

#### Table 3 – Type of changes that can be captured in the GeoPrism Registry

| Type               | Description                                                                             | Example                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Start of existence | The start of existence of the geographic object                                         | Opening a new health facility, creation of a new district                                                          |
| Value change       | A change in value for a given data element including parents in a hierarchy or geometry | Change of health facility name, phone number, or status or the geographic location/extent of the geographic object |
| End of existence   | The end of existence of the geographic object                                           | Closure of a health facility, end of existence of a province being merged with another one                         |

Figure 4 provides an illustration of these main types of changes for a health facility that opened on April 19, 1984, and closed definitively on April 1, 2021. Over that period, the health facility’s name, head, and phone number each changed once at different points in time.

For this kind of change, the GeoPrism Registry has the capacity to:&#x20;

* Set the period of existence of the geographic object (1984-04-19 to 2021-04-01)&#x20;
* Capture and retain the value for each instance of the data elements that have changed through time together with the period over which each value has been valid (e.g., Patrick Dupont over the 1984-04-19 to 2008-06-06 period and then Henri Dunant over the 2008-06-06 to 2021-04-01 period as the health facility head).

Capturing the above information is sufficient to understand changes occurring to any independently created geographic objects, i.e., geographic objects that are not being created out of already existing ones (e.g., infrastructures such as health facilities or schools).

All of this happens as part of the management of the lists in the GeoPrism Registry. Please refer to Section 6.5.1 for more details on how this information is being captured and managed in the GeoPrism Registry.

The situation is different when looking at the changes occurring through time for geographic objects that are being carved out from existing one to start their existence. For example, this occurs when boundaries change (e.g., split or merge) across administrative, health, statistical, or electoral units covering the entire territory of a given country.

When this is the case, capturing the period over which each unit has been in existence is not sufficient to rebuild these changes. To illustrate this, Figure 5 captures the changes that occurred through time for part of the districts of Uganda over the January 1, 1990, to June 30, 2005, period.

#### Figure 5 – Example of changes occurring over time for a subset of the districts of Uganda

While the district of Soroti, for example, has been in existence over the complete period reported in Figure 6, its geographic extent has significantly changed twice over that same period. In this case, a CGR should be able to capture the period of existence of the district of Soroti as well as the two changes in question including the indication of the instance (single occurrence) of the district of Soroti from which the district of Katakwi in March 1997 and then the district of Kaberamaido in July 2007 have been carved.

For such cases, the GeoPrism Registry has the capacity to capture:&#x20;

* The date of the change&#x20;
* The type of change (split, merge, transfer, upgrade, downgrade)&#x20;
* The type of geographic object before and after the change (same type in the case of a split, merge, or transfer or different type in the case of an upgrade or downgrade)&#x20;
* The unique identifier and name of the geographic object before and after the change&#x20;
* Notes allowing to understand and/or track the change (e.g., the legal document in which the change is recorded)

It does then allow the user to generate a report containing all the historic changes (events) for a given type of geo-objects and this over a specific period in time. Please refer to [Section 6.5.3](../geoprism-registry-tutorial/#6.5.3) For more information regarding how the historic events information is being captured and included in such a report.

### 5.2.2 Unique identifier

Critical to data interoperability is the ability to uniquely, and therefore unequivocally, identify each of the geographic objects in the GeoPrism Registry and ensure that this unique identifier is used across information systems. Therefore, it may be beneficial to use geography as a neutral platform for the integration of information and data coming from different sources.

While the selection of the appropriate coding scheme associated with each type of geographic object is not a functionality of the platform, the GeoPrism Registry has the capacity to capture and maintain such a scheme.

The choice of an appropriate coding scheme to be associated with each type of geographic object is therefore critical as modifying the scheme once implemented in different systems can not only be costly but also have a significant impact on data compatibility as well as on the trust in the CGR content.

Please refer to the CGR guidance \[1], the master facility list resource package \[5] and the implementation support guide for the development of a national georeferenced community health work master list \[6] for more guidance on the choice of an appropriate coding scheme.

### 5.2.3 Master vs non-master

The primary objective of a Common Geo-Registry is to share the authoritative data coming from the governmental entity having the official curation mandate over it. This is what is being referred to as the master data and information \[5,6].

While this is indeed the type of data and information that should be hosted in priority in the GeoPrism Registry to serve as the source of truth, it is possible that either the master data/information is not available, not of quality (incomplete, out-of-date…), and/or not accessible.

In these cases, and to ensure the continuity of operations, the GeoPrism Registry can host, manage, and share “non-master” data/information in parallel or in complement to the master one (meaning that both types should be clearly differentiated) as well as facilitate the converge the two lists once the master version is available, of quality, and/or accessible.

### 5.2.4 Accessibility

The full value of a Common Geo-Registry is expressed once its content is accessible to the largest number of users possible.

This being said, it is possible that not all content can be made publicly accessible, at least not at first (appropriate government approvals might be required, a certain level of quality needs to be reached and/or the necessary policy and legal framework be in place).

The GeoPrism Registry currently provides two levels of access (referred to as visibility in the platform) for the geo-object types, lists and spatial data it contains :&#x20;

* Public: The item is accessible to any user from within the platform and to external users through an API&#x20;
* Private: The item is only accessible to the organization having the curation mandate over it

Having these levels of accessibility for the content allows the platform to respect the current accessibility policy that each organization might want to apply to the content they are hosting in the platform while still benefiting from the functionalities it provides, but also to change such a level as the data sharing policy associated with this content evolves.

In the future the GeoPrism is meant to add other levels of access (restricted to given organizations for example), to apply these levels to hierarchies and to implement the rules reported in section 2.7.4 of the [CGR guidance document](https://healthgeolab.net/DOCUMENTS/Guidance\_Common\_Geo-registry\_Ve2.pdf).

### 5.2.5 Documentation (metadata)

Documenting the content of the GeoPrism Registry in a way that informs the users if such content corresponds to their needs is key to the proper use of this content

At this stage, GeoPrism Registry allows the authorized user to fill, manage and share a medata profile for the following key elements managed in the platform:&#x20;

* Organization&#x20;
* User Geo-object types and groups&#x20;
* Hierarchies&#x20;
* Lists&#x20;
* Spatial data

The content of such a profile is different for each of these elements and described in more detail in the GPR tutorial.

### 5.2.6 Languages and character encoding

In addition to the possibility for GeoPrism Registry user’s interface to be localized (see Section 3.4) users have the possibility to import, store and share the information associated with each data element in the local language.

Thanks to the libraries it integrates, GeoPrism Registry is able to cover any language as long as it is based on the UNICODE character encoding system.
