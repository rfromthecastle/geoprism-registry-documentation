# 6.5.1.5 Edit

{% hint style="info" %}
The System Administrator, Registry Administrators and Registry Maintainers can directly edit the lists and spatial data of the Geo-Object Types under the curation mandate of their organization.
{% endhint %}

The list and spatial data of a Geo-Object Type can be modified to add a new geo-object or edit an existing geo-object. The following sections provide the steps to be followed to effect these modifications.

### Add a new geo-object

1. Go to the Lists and Spatial Data module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Lists and Spatial Data.\

2. On the left sidebar, find and click the Geo-Object Type you would like to add a geo-object to under the organization it belongs to. Then click its list and spatial data set. (The Community health worker Geo-Object Type in the example below.)\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png>)
3. Depending on the list type of the set, you might see one or more validity dates/periods. In the validity date/period you would like to edit, click Lists under the Working Version section.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png>)
4. The list for the Geo-Object Type will open. Click the Add Geo-Object button.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)
5. This will open the Geo-Object Type in the Explorer module ready for editing. First, to enforce that this geo-object is existing, make sure that the “Yes” button is selected in the Exists section. Then type or select the date of validity of the geo-object that you are adding that will match the date of validity of the set you are adding it to.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)
6. In the Validity section, make sure that the valid button is selected.
7. You can then add the information for the new geo-object in the different data elements tab.
   1. Attributes: The number of attribute information to be provided depends on the number of attributes created for the Geo-Object Type.
   2. Hierarchies: The number of parent Geo-Object Type information that would have to be provided depends on the number of hierarchies the Geo-Object Type belongs to and its position in those hierarchies.
   3. Geometry: Aside from the validity period, you may also be able edit the geometry of the Geo-Object depending on whether this functionality has been enabled for this particular list and spatial data set.
8. Once all the information has been provided, click the Submit button.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)
9. If there is no issue with the changes made, you will get a message that the edit is submitted successfully to the system. Click the Ok button.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)
10. If you would like to add another Geo-Object to the same Geo-Object Type list and spatial data set in this same session, click on the Layers Panel button (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GS9dmxAt4iKNmCZojlF7\_yTYOS4zveB\_nkoY5i\_PYZ4ZmZ0YCXrNowfKD74yKfbff3dB5Og1LES2C8DM75ngqAjgGa7RhPfcAw4PJpeipayjKFuRw1JCqk96-uuOZ2MZv0eUDxx1I64WaUREHJ7I\_LkFh5VLGQXheepM7kUfCQVASxLajpdU7\_WjjA)) at the upper right corner of the window.
11. This will open the Layers Panel. Click on the Add New Geo-Object button (![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Lt0ZdLDMJHY\_Pef6Ru804rIMqkqn05zOYMFa7vK6JoWck36D-\_twoPSHyDz3\_cp5toZkNovIl2rMypgRvk\_\_Mk\_3Hos\_il5BnGAdRYlycfxIOvQg36-VcZHRDineICp6Q5pxzM5NjKQY5g3a1ZLKYOqAH04DBEr37UCznvIWvkuAVuY5\_LLLvJVySQ)).\

12. Repeat steps 5 to 9 to add the information about the new geo-object.

### **Edit an existing geo-object**

To edit an existing geo-object:

1. Go to the Lists and Spatial Data module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Lists and Spatial Data.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1).png>)
2. On the left sidebar, find and click the Geo-Object Type you would like to edit under the organization it belongs to. Then click its list and spatial data set. (The County Geo-Object Type in the example below.)\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png>)
3. Depending on the list type of the set, you might see one or more validity dates/periods. In the validity date/period you would like to edit, click Lists under the Working Version section.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)
4. The list for the Geo-Object Type will open. Find or filter the geo-object you would like to edit from the list and click the Eye icon (![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EqUKCHVeChCW9J37GH46HYv9Ymm0miGlBXGf6Job9MB9X2FGGpMDDFPsJlbRFpW-KyFjcSuuJEApZtivwT4r8Bnr76usqZ1IoVkDjoUzvYGc1zJXxS2ZxSq3cka214983-Yg39oTsQiSSTum1wfYH4RX9Jb96umiEPFEhwN0CGHFuYGP0qJECd5FQw)) at the beginning of the corresponding row.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png>)
5. This will open the spatial data in the Explorer module with the particular geo-object highlighted and ready for editing. Click the Edit button in the pop-up information window.\
   ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/89\_IEtd\_xzZUv-HSANnK90H3skG8DsssHC8QJYBya0JAI\_oNVlCw\_LAwnoONaK1TtLveShWMtVS2UkUTfffo9iATCT94YxkKOerFDCaJAFop1y8PjcWd4Wp395lpgIS-4GPFHdXhiXlCD32oNHTy7Yn4xraPtHcL8CBNo2haQPvYzt2fEbD8vGGW1A)
6. This will display the information for that particular geo-object in the left sidebar. Click the Edit button to start the editing session.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)
7. Click on the data elements tab (Attributes, Hierarchies, Geometry) containing the information you would like to edit.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)
8.  Once in the correct data elements tab, make the necessary change/s to the information you would like to edit.\


    GPR marks the data elements tab with change/s with an orange dot, changes the font color of the modified information to orange, and indicate the type of change that has been made:

    1. Value change: If only the attribute value has been modified\
       ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)
    2. Time Change: If only the date of validity has been modified\
       ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)
    3. Update: If both the attribute value and date of validity of the geo-object have been modified\
       ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)
9. If you would like to undo the changes that have been made in a data element tab, click the revert arrow button.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png>)
10. When all the changes have been made, click the _Submit_ button.\
    ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png>)
11. If there is no issue with the changes made, you will get a message that the edit is submitted successfully to the system. Click the Ok button.
12. If you would like to make changes to another geo-object, click its corresponding geometry on the map then repeat steps 5 to 11.\
