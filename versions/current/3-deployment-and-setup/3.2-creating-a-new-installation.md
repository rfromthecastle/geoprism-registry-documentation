# 3.2. Creating a new installation

{% hint style="info" %}
This documentation is written assuming you are using [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) with an Amazon Linux 2 operating system. While it is possible to install GeoPrism Registry on other environments, this documentation does not cover the configuration differences that may be needed.
{% endhint %}

### 3.2.1. Hardware requirements

The standard hardware for the target machine is an AWS r4.large server (16 GB RAM), as GeoPrism Registry tends to be memory intensive, and 500GB gp2 (general purpose SSD) hard drives.

The software requirements are as follows:&#x20;

* Docker version 20.0 or greater&#x20;
* docker-compose version 3

### 3.2.2. SSL

GeoPrism Registry is configured to use HTTP by default. Any SSL/HTTPS configuration should be done outside of the GeoPrism Registry web container. The recommended way to do this is to use a reverse proxy.

### 3.2.3. Installation, configuration and update

The most current documentation on how to install and configure as well as update GeoPrism Registry to any new release can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/terraframe/geoprism-registry).
