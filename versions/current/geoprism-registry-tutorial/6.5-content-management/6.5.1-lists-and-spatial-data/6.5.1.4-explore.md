# 6.5.1.4 Explore

{% hint style="info" %}
Registry Administrators, Registry Maintainers, and Registry Contributors can explore the lists and spatial data of the Geo-Object Types under the curation mandate of their organization.

Other users can explore lists and spatial data of Geo-Object Types that are made visible to the public by the organization the Geo-Object Type belongs to.
{% endhint %}

The list and spatial data of a Geo-Object Type either from a Working Version or a Published Version can be explored through the List and Spatial Data and Explorer modules.

### **Explore a list**

1. Go to the Lists and Spatial Data module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Lists and Spatial Data.\

2. On the left sidebar, find and click the Geo-Object Type you would like to explore under the organization it belongs to. Then click its list and spatial data set. (The County Geo-Object Type in the example below.)\

3. Depending on the list type of the set, you might see one or more validity dates/periods. In the validity date/period you would like to explore, you may click on the Metadata button to see the information about the list and spatial data of the Geo-Object Type. To close the Metadata window, click on the Cancel or Back button at the bottom.\

4. Still in the validity date/period you would like to explore, click Lists under either Working Versions or Published Versions (based on your user access, availability of the published versions, and needs).\

5. The list for the Geo-Object Type will open. You can explore the list by:&#x20;
   1. Sorting the content of any attribute alphabetically or numerically in ascending or descending order by clicking the arrows by the column name. (The header of the attribute with the sorted content is colored green.)\
      ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)
   2. Filtering the content by typing the needed value in the filter/search field under the corresponding attribute header. This will return only the geo-object/s whose content matches the entered value.\

### Explore spatial data

1. Go to the Lists and Spatial Data module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Lists and Spatial Data.\

2. On the left sidebar, find and click the Geo-Object Type you would like to explore under the organization it belongs to. Then click its list and spatial data set. (The County Geo-Object Type in the example below.)\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png>)
3. Depending on the list type of the set, you might see one or more validity dates/periods. In the validity date/period you would like to explore, you may click on the Metadata button to see the information about the list and spatial data of the Geo-Object Type. To close the Metadata window, click on the Cancel or Back button at the bottom.\

4. To open and explore the spatial data:&#x20;
   1. Through the list:
      1. Still in the validity date/period you would like to explore, click List under either Working Versions or Published Versions (based on your user access, availability of the published versions, and needs).\
         ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)
      2. When the list opens, click on the View on map button.\
         ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)
5. You will be redirected to the Explorer module where the spatial data of the Geo-Object Type will be displayed. You can zoom in and out and pan the map to look at the spatial data.\
