# 6.5.1.6 Curate

{% hint style="info" %}
Two types of semi-automatic curation are being implemented in the GPR at this stage:&#x20;

1. The SA, RA and RM can check if some of the records in the working list do not have geometry&#x20;
2. The GPR is automatically producing tasks in the curation module each time a new historical event (see [Section 6.5.3](../6.5.3-historical-events.md)) requires for some changes to be applied by the RA or RM on given geo-objects (example: the split of a district requiring for the health facilities located in part of it to be reassigned to the new one that has been created)

Apart from the above, the SA, RA, RM and RC role can also use the sort functionality in an open list to identify geo-objects presenting empty values for a given attribute
{% endhint %}

**To identify the geo-objects that do not have a geometry in an open list** (the check is performed in the list and not the graph, meaning that it is performed only for the temporal validity of that list, date or period):

1. Go to the Lists and Spatial Data module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting Lists and Spatial Data.\

2. On the left sidebar, find and click the Geo-Object Type for which you would like to identify the geo-objects without geometry in the open list (health center for example). Open the set containing the list presenting the temporal validity for which you want to perform the curation (the frequency-based on in this case:\
   ****![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (34) (1).png>)****
3. Open the working version of the instance of the list for which you want to perform the curation (2022-01-01 here)\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)
4. In the list that opens, click the Run curation button\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (18) (4).png>)
5. A curation report will appear in the window:&#x20;
   1. If there is at least one geo-object for which the geometry is missing in the list, the report will indicate for which record this is the case:\
      ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png>)
   2. If all the geo-object have a geometry then the report will be empty\
      ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (16) (2).png>)
6. If there are geo-objects listed in the report, take a screenshot of the window or write the geo-objects code down (Note: the last run will remain accessible until the next one by clicking on the link on the right of the Run Curation button\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png>)
7. Go back to the list and address the gap if possible

#### To view the tasks generated in relation to historical events that have been captured:

1. Go to the Curation module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LXLYgQWXwF0Rm7eHKexpUu\_GXCMOZeSIZSyoj08-me4GjBUwtbljSg5P5twFI3HRGtbRvwD6L6cq0YyYZirbgNV45ESEyeBZPGvQDokvpyUyA88pGI5HyxeW7fvvpPz6\_vSMOeLuk62zspLP\_uedmw\_jlEURxV6ACuRE4p-fpiGrvrqD86w26a6Z9Q)) on the upper right corner and selecting Curation.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (2).png>)
2. In the Curation page, there are two sections: Open Tasks and Completed Tasks. In the Open Tasks section, you will see the tasks related to geo-objects over which you have the curation mandate and for which hierarchy related information might need to be changed due to an historical event that has been captured for one of its parents. In the example below, as the MOH RA or RM, you are being informed that the Santa Rosa Shire has been merged into the Bacong Shire on 04/20/07 and suggested to look if any of the national hospitals were located in in the Santa Rosa Shire as they might have to be reassigned to the Bacong one starting from 04/20/07.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (17) (4).png>)
3. To know more about the event mentioned in the task, you may go to the Historical Events module to explore the particular historical event the Geo-Object is a part of ([Section 6.5.3](../6.5.3-historical-events.md)) to know how to explore historical events.
4. The number of changes you would have to apply depends on the number of geo-objects impacted by the historical event that has been captured. In the above task for example, all the national hospitals located in the Santa Rosa shire before 04/20/07 will have to be reassigned to the Bacong shire after that date. Depending on the number of changes you have to apply, you may either:
   1. Import a spreadsheet containing the geo-objects that are being impacted together with the new parent information (See Section 6.5.1.1 above to know how to import a spreadsheet).
   2. Edit each impacted Geo-Object separately using the Lists and Spatial Data module (see Section 6.5.1.4 above to know how to edit an existing Geo-Object).
5. Once the changes have been made, go back to the Curation module. Find the task that has been addressed and mark it as complete by clicking the Complete button. The task will now be moved to the Completed Tasks section.\

6. If you have incorrectly marked a task as complete, you may go to the Completed Tasks section, find the particular task, and mark it as open again.\
