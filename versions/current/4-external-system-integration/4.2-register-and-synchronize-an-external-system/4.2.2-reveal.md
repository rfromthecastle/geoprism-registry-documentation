# 4.2.2 Reveal

### Registration

The following steps describe how to register a Reveal External System. A Reveal External System enables the ability to import Geo-Object data with ID’s from a Reveal system and to read data using the REST API that includes the Reveal External IDs:&#x20;

1. Navigate to the settings page.&#x20;
2. Find the External Systems section and click the '+' button to open the registration modal.\

| GPR data type | Appropriate REVEAL value types                                                                                        | Required |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Type          | The type of external system.                                                                                          | Yes      |
| Organization  | The organization you belong to. An external system will only be available to data and users within this organization. | Yes      |
| ID            | The ID for this external system.                                                                                      | Yes      |
| Label         | The label of the external system.                                                                                     | Yes      |
| Description   | The description of the external system.                                                                               | No       |

### Import

If Geo-Object data is already present in a Reveal instance, it must first be imported to the GPR using the ‘Import from an external system’ option in the Import module after the Reveal external system has been registered (see the [Import section](../../geoprism-registry-tutorial/6.5-content-management/6.5.1-lists-and-spatial-data/6.5.1.1-import.md)). Uploading data from a Reveal system in this way stores the IDs from the Reveal system data on the Geo-Objects that are imported/created in the GPR. These Reveal IDs will be used during synchronization to match GPR Geo-Objects with data in Reveal.

### Synchronization

The Reveal External System registration enables the API to be used to query Geo-Objects with Reveal ID's in a Reveal format. Reveal External Systems don't have a configurable interface for pushing data like DHIS2 systems but automated synchronizations could be made with external programs that utilize the GPR API.
